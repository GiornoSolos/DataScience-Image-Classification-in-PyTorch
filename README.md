Data Science project that was made for the university from scratch. The first part utilizes basic machine learning principles. The second part focuses on clustering. The third part uses Neural networks using PyTorch. Refer to the PDF file for EDA and the corresponding report. 

I had approximately a week to complete this project, the objective was to be able to describe the data science process from scratch and utilize all the techniques in the course we had learned to this point. To effectively make my neural network classify the images accurately I changed my initialization class to utilize the Torch.NN.linear module which greatly simplified the process of writing the rest of the code and helped me to fully understand concepts such as the structure of neural networks and the process of backpropagation in Machine Learning.
